- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zzmv (Zachary Vandeputte)
I am a self-driven, critical thinker, and work excellently independently studying and researching various topics, questions, and information necessary for a task I aim to complete. My areas of study include Philosophy, Political Science, and Computer Science as a personal interest. I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. My peers would describe me as a natural and intuitive leader, always aiming to provide the quickest or most effective solution to the task at hand. I'm a soon-to-be recent graduate from Indiana University in May, seeking entry-level work upon graduation. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities that would allow me to combine my critical thinking capabilities and technical background in order to create fulfilling solutions. Specific fields of interest include data analytics, information technology, public policy, project management, and the legal system.
